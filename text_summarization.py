red_riding_hood = 'Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood. One day her mother said to her, "Come, Little Red Riding Hood, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine. Take them to your grandmother, she is ill and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing. And when you go into her room, dont forget to say, good-morning, and dont peep into every corner before you do it." I will take great care, said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it. The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her. Little Red Riding Hood did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him. "Good-day, Little Red Riding Hood," said he. "Thank you kindly, wolf." "Whither away so early, Little Red Riding Hood?" "To my grandmothers." "What have you got in your apron?""Cake and wine. Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger." "Where does your grandmother live, Little Red Riding Hood?" "A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood. Her house stands under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below. You surely must know it," replied Little Red Riding Hood.The wolf thought to himself, "What a tender young creature. What a nice plump mouthful, she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must act craftily, so as to catch both." So he walked for a short time by the side of Little Red Riding Hood, and then he said, "see Little Red Riding Hood, how pretty the flowers are about here. Why do you not look round. I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing. You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else out here in the wood is merry."Little Red Riding Hood raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay. That would please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time. And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and deeper into the wood.'
bonnie_clyde_transcript = "Do have a story about Bonnie and Clyde and I believe this came to mind just a couple of weeks ago because we had. City days. Sitting straight. One of the men from Channel 6 was interviewing people standing alongside the Parade route and the woman said she had a story about buying the tide had come to the ranch and stolen her father's car and that made me think of an incident that happened. Logan September, I believe 1933. My mother, my sister and I lived in a little house in Dodge City Kansas or I was born, my father was born there, also not in that house, but in that town and if a car drove up late evening kind of a boxy looking car man and woman in the front seat. At least one man in the back seat. That my sister and I were I was probably 12 13 years old and she was four years younger than eyes sitting on the porch. And the car stopped. The driver got out. Kind of surveyed the area around came up towards the porch and the woman under the passenger seat. Up to she leaned against the car, Thomas and Lady. Cross directors, get their homeless man. Came to the front door. Mother answered the door. He asked if she was mrs. Conaway. And she said she was. He would like she was register of deeds in Ford County for a number of years and he told her he was interested in some property. I would like to see the sisters books and she said, my goodness, I certainly can't do that now because it's late in the evening and the faults that contain, those records is on a time, lock it. So I will be glad to see you at 9:00 tomorrow morning. Well my last conversation was going on the woman standing next to the ER for herself out a cigar and let it go, pick up smoking it, my sister and I were just called and such thing going on the man think mother and started to walk from the porch and they turned around and said may I have a drink of water. Who said yes, of course but she didn't have presence of mind enough to hook the screen door and she turned to go back to get the water. He followed her in the house. Well, my sister died, being curious mounts to login into the kitchen, also to see if he was going to get his washer. And he did, I do not recall that he glanced around in a lot of things that were there. But I, as I grew to an elf and don't I feel like probably he was surveying the premises looking to see if there were men or a man present and if there were guns visible or not visible, but it's like her and he laughed. As they drove away. My mother put her hands on her hips and says, well girls did you see that? That woman was smoking a cigar while they went on. He did not show up the next morning at the courthouse, to get the land information that he wanted. About 3 or 4 days later in the Daily Globe, Dodge City, Daily Globe, there was quite a stir and an article about a couple store of car from a Rancher. A app that stole another car and went to meet Kansas. Where in their park, there was a picnic going on, people are enjoying playing games and so forth, the car drove up and the man that got out of the car that approached the group of people in the park. I haven't tried to kidnap an older man. His wife was not going to have anything to do with that. Fancy tried to drag him off, to the car, she just beat the heck out of one of them was the driver of the car. Okay. Well, the story in the globe then stated that, that was Clyde Barrow. And the woman with him, was Bonnie Parker. So in their pictures, came out in the globe window made it like they were the people who had visited us at our house so we really felt like we were something to see. Get to see Bonnie, heart, what are the articles there. After that said that Machine Gun Kelly was also in the car and Pretty Boy. Floyd those were gangsters from Chicago and I think maybe borrow Clyde may have lived there at one time in 1931. I believe I'd worked in Hugoton. Bonnie Works in Dodge City, a little Drive in Sandwich Shop called the black cow, and she was a car. She was quite attractive. I understand tall, and slender, and a brunette. So that is our story is, Bonnie Clyde. They were not captured permanently and killed until 1974, and I think that was in the Louisiana, they have a lot of stuff trips in and out in the round Enid. Oklahoma, and one of the articles that I read stated that they've started, but I don't think they ever realize they actually came in and stopped at our house. When I look at these that I found the paper that pictures and it's kind of cold chills thinking about close. We were to those gangsters or Bandits they call it that time."
the_invisible_man_test = "Chapter 2 mr. Teddy Humphries. First impressions, At 4, when it was fairly dark and mrs. Hall was screwing up a carriage to go in and ask her visitor. If you would take some to eat Teddy and free the clock driver came into the bar. My cycling is set for. This is terrible weather for 10 V. Snow outside was folding fountain. This is all agreed and then noticed he had his back with him now you are mr. Teddy said she would be glad if you give the Old Clock in the part of it look just going and it strikes but and hockey. But the hour hand what do nothing but pointed Stakes And leading the way she went across to the Parlor door and rent and ended. A visitor. She saw her. She opened. The door was seated in the armchair before the fire dozing, it would seem with his bandaged head drooping on one side. The only light in the room with the red glow from the fire which Lucy's eyes like adverse Railway signals. But left his down cost face in darkness and the scanty vestiges of the day that came in through the open door. Everything was ready shadowy an indistinct, the most ever since she is jumping lighting the bottom and her eyes with that sold before. Second it seemed to her that the man she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open of Austin. Incredible mouth, that's one of the whole of the lower portion of his face. It was the sensation of a moment, the wind found had the most goggle eyes of this. Huge you on below it. Then he stood started up in his chair. In Hammond. She opened the door when I took the room was like and she saw him more clearly with the muffler held up to his face. Just as she had seen him hold this event before. The Shadows. She fancied that Richter. Would you mind said this man is coming to look at the clock. So she said recovering from the momentary shock look at the clock, he said standing around in a driving Manner, and speaking of his head and then getting more fully awake, sir, This is all went away to get the lamp and heroes and stretched himself. Then came the light and Mr. Teddy hand-free entering was confronted by the Spanish. The person he was he says taken aback. Good afternoon set the stranger regarding him as mr. Henry says, we live. It sends of the dark spectacles, like a lobster. I hope Sana 10 ft that it's no intrusion. At none. What have I said to change it though? I understand he said telling him his whole. That this room is ready to be mind my own private use. I thought suicide was told, you'd prefer the clock suddenly said, strange it suddenly, but as a rule, I like to be alone and undisturbed. But I'm really glad that the clock seem to be said, seeing a certain hesitation to mister Henry's Mana paragliding. Miss Henry, had intended to apologize and withdraw but this anticipation reassured him. The Stranger turned around with his back to the fireplace and put his hands behind his back. And presently. He said, when the clock mending is over, I think I should like to have some tea, but not to look like mending is over. Midget hole was about to leave the room. She made no conversation and Promises this time because she did not want to be snuffed in front of mr. Henry, when he visited often if you'd made any Arrangements about his boxes at brown, but she told him, she had mentioned the matter to the postman, and that the carrier could bring them over on the morrow. You are setting the Dodgers DL list. He said, She was sitting with the Mount of coldness. I should explain why I did. What I was really too cold and fatigue to do before, but I am an experimental investigation. Indita to mrs. Hold much impressed and my package contains apparatus and appliances. They're useful things, indeed. They also said me so and I'm very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries. Of course. My reason for coming to Iving you proceed with us. And deliberation of man of was a desire for Solitude. I do not wish to be disturbed in my work. In addition to my work, an accident. I thought as much that misses hold myself, an accident, necessitates a set in retirement, my eyes sometimes so weak and painful, but I've shut myself up in the dark for hours together. Lock myself up sometimes now and then no surprise incessantly. But at such times, the slightest disturbance, the entry of a stranger into the room is a source of excruciating annoying to me. It is well, these things would be understood. Suddenly Sarah Fitness hope and if I might make so bold as to ask that, I think is a little sad stranger without quietly irresistible error finality. He could assume it will I just hold receptor question and sympathy for a better education. Optimus is all that left the room. He remain standing in front of the fire glaring, Samantha Henry posted at the clock wedding. Mr. Henry took off the hands of the clock in the face, but extracted the works. And he tried to work in a slow and quiet and unassuming manner as possible. Do I put the lamp close to him and the green shade through brilliant light upon his hands and upon the frame and wheels and left the rest of the room Shadow me. When he looks up colored patches around his eyes. Being constitutionally of a curious nature. He had removed wax a quite unnecessary proceeding with the idea of delaying his departure, and perhaps falling into conversation with the stranger. But the strangest thought that perfectly silent and still. So still, it goes on. Henry's nerves. He felt alone in the room and looked out and they're gray and then was the bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly cuz I missed a green spots drifting in front of them. it was so uncanny to Henry that for a minute, they remain staring blankly one another Then Henry, look down again. Very uncomfortable position. One would like to say something to you remind me that the weather was very cold front of the year. He looked up as if to take Aiden with an introductory short to whether he began. Why don't you finish and go said the rigid figure evidently in a state of painfully, surprised rage. All you got to do is fix the hour hand on its axis. Sydney said, one minute more, I overlooked a mr. Henry finished and went, but he was feeling excessively annoyed. Damn, it is to the falling snow. I managed to at times shortly and again, counterman look at you ugly. And yet again, seemingly not The police was wanting you you wouldn't be more wrapped in bandaged. I think he's going to he's so hold. Good recently married. The strangest has tested for coach and horses. And who now drove the piping conveyance, when occasional people required it to see the bridge Junction coming to watch him on his return from that place. Hold it. Evidently been a stopping event that celebrates to judge by his driving. How do Teddy said passing? You've got rum enough at home set, Teddy. Holbrooks actually pulled up. What's that? You said? Rough-looking customer stopping at the coach and horses that Teddy my sakes. But he proceeded to give hold a vivid description of his grotesque guest. Looks a bit like a disguise, don't it? I'd like to see a man's face. If I had him stopping in my face and said Henry, but women are that Trussville. When strangers are concerned? He's Tokyo rooms in the end, even given a name. You don't say. So I was at hold, it was a man of sluggish apprehension. Yes. That Teddy by the week or every is you can't get rid of him under the week and he's got a lot of luggage coming tomorrow. So he says, let's hope it won't be stones in boxes. How he told whole house is haunted Hastings. Being swindled by strange with empty, portmanteau altogether, he left, hold vaguely suspicious. Get a logo that hope I suppose. I must see about this. Teddy trucks on his way with his mind, considerably relieved. Instead of seeing that, however, hole on his return was severely rated by his wife on the length of time, you spent into the bridge and his mild inquiries, were on Snap. Ashley and in a manner, not to the point that the seed of Suspicion Teddy at 7, germinate in the mind of mr. Hole in spite of these discoveries means you win, don't know anything that missed the whole result to ascertain more about the personality of his guests at the earliest possible opportunity. Do to the stranger come to bed. If you did about 9:30, missed the whole 130 aggressively into the Parlor and look very hard at his wife, Furniture, just to show that the stranger was announced today and scrutinize plays lyanna little contentiously or she just mathematical computations The Strangers left. When retiring, for the night, he instructed me to look very closely at the strangest like it when they came the next day. You mind your own business whole, send message hole and I'll mind mine. She was all the more inclined to snap and hold because the stranger was undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger. And she was by no means a short about him in her own mind. In the middle of the night, she woke up dreaming of huge whiteheads like tenants that came trailing off to her at the end of interminable next and with a soft black eyes. But being a sensible woman, she's so cute. A terrorist and turned over and went to sleep again. End of chapter 2. Recorded by Alex Foster, ww.w., Alex Foster. Me. Don't you K in Nottingham?

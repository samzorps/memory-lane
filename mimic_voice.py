                    a desolate and industrial area between West Egg and New York City. Nick visits Tom Buchanan, his wealthy \
                    and unfaithful cousin, at his mistress's apartment in New York. Tom introduces Nick to Myrtle Wilson, his mistress, and her sister Catherine.\
                    Tom and Myrtle, along with Nick and some others, take a train to New York City, where they continue to drink \
                    and party. They eventually end up at the apartment of Tom's friends, the McKees. Myrtle becomes increasingly drunk\
                    and begins to talk loudly and flirt with Tom, much to Nick's discomfort.\
                    As the night wears on, Tom becomes increasingly aggressive and hostile, leading to a physical altercation between \
                    him and Myrtle. The party eventually comes to an end, and Nick is left to reflect on the destructive nature of Tom's \
                    affair and the decadence and moral decay of the wealthy elite. The chapter ends with Nick returning to his small cottage \
                    in West Egg, feeling disillusioned with the world he has encountered in New York."
